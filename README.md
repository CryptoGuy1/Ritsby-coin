# Ritsby-coin
This is my meme coin and I will be calling it Ritsby.  With a total supply of 1000 tokens and the symbol RITS. My contract will mint some tokens and i will be able to send them to MetaMask users on the Rinkeby testnet.
Instead of writing my own ERC-20 from scratch which can expose the code to security vulnerabilities i will use OpenZepplin's ERC-20 library which offers an audited boilerplate and a ton of helpful built-in functions.
